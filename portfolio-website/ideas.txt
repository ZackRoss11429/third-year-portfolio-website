mayhaps backend can turn the library into an array of books such that when a new map is made, I can pick
another book in that array and use two page layout templates to decorate each book page with taped pictures and
descriptions??? Also editing existing books for ongoing projects

Furthering this, when books are clicked on, the player's view is moved to the table where the desired book is placed
and the player can go through it. Other interactables would just fixed the camera to the object more clearly and pop up
various details.
